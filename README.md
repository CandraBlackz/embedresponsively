ABOUT
=================

<a href='http://embedresponsively.com/">EmbedResponsively</a> is a webapp to help content producers transform their fixed width embedded content to fluid shapeshifing awesomeness via responsive magic.

We prefer CSS based fixes but are not averse to a smidge of Javascript here and there.

If you have a problematic embed or a pernicious element that's not currently covered here, get in touch! Hopeflly we work it out and can add it in.

Thanks,
